# AvgGrades
## Project Overview
### Purpose
This project finds the averages of columns and rows in an array of students' grades and sorts the grades using selection sort.
### Features
- Arrays
- Methods
- Sorting Algorithms
### Prerequisites
- Java
  - Skills: methods, arrays, sorting algorithms
- Unix Commands
## Project Setup
### Running the Code
Download the files from the GitHub repository. Open the files in an IDE. In the IDE terminal, navigate to the folder where the files are held using the Unix command "cd". Once in the correct folder, compile all of the files using the command "javac fileName" and run the code using the command "java fileName".
